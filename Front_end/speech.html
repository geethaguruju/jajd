            <textarea id="txt" cols="90" rows="25" style="border: 0;border-bottom: 1px solid #E8DED2c9;;text-align: left;padding: 10.4px;margin: 10px;background: #E8DED2c9;">Written by Lucy Guan, Master of Public Health student at Columbia University with an interest in sexuality and reproductive health.Comprehensive sexual education and conversations with adolescents about sexual pleasure and intimacy are even more important during and after the COVID-19 pandemic than they were before, especially as the return to a new normal may be approaching. Normally, the teenage years are marked by budding independence, social pressures and interests in relationships and sexual intimacy. Throughout the pandemic, teenagers have experienced limitations in their ability to explore connections and mingle with their peers. Their social connections have been profoundly impacted by stay-at-home orders and school closures all around the world. As they come out of a period of their lives defined by virtual interactions and time spent alone, teenagers may feel like they will be making up for lost time. Stay-at-home orders and parents close by have prevented some teenagers from having partnered sex. Unsurprisingly, they have been using more digital communication, including romantic and sexual interactions via online conversations through social media, sexting, and other online activities. As most countries are easing out of lockdown, adolescents can now expect to spend more time in school with their peers. When it comes to sex and relationships, independently of the ongoing pandemic, teenagers should be equipped with a sense of agency, not just in knowing how to have safe sex, but how to have a positive experience and how to comfortably talk about it. Asking for consent or asking about a partnerâ€™s sexual history, while not easy, are relatively straightforward ideas. What happens after is more complicated. Unlike how to correctly use a condom, there are no step-by-step instructions on how to navigate sexual feelings. Now is the time to encourage young people to feel empowered to explore their sexuality, as the pandemic has introduced new challenges that will likely remain for some time.
